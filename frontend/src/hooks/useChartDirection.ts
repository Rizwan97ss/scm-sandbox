 * SVG `text-anchor="start"/"end"` is direction-relative per the CSS

 * LocaleContext), "start" anchors to the visual *right* and text grows
 * leftward, the mirror image of what recharts' own tick-positioning math
 * assumes (it's written assuming "start" always means visual left). The
 * result without this: every axis tick label silently renders shifted in
 * the wrong direction. Forcing `direction: ltr` on the chart's own
 * container resets text-anchor to the absolute (non-relative) meaning
 * recharts expects, so its layout math is correct again — the actual RTL
 * mirroring is still done deliberately via `horizontalAxisProps`/
 * `startOrientation` below, which are plain numeric/enum props recharts
 * computes independently of CSS direction.

 * the left, values still flowing left-to-right, while every other on-page
 * label reads right-to-left. Spread `horizontalAxisProps` onto the
 * categorical XAxis and use `startOrientation` on the numeric YAxis (the
 * axis that should sit on the reading direction's start side) to mirror
