# API Reference

Base URL: `{APP_URL}/api/v1`. All responses use the envelope described in
[architecture.md § Response envelope](architecture.md#response-envelope).
All routes below except `auth/login`, `auth/forgot-password`,
`auth/reset-password`, and `settings/public` require an authenticated
Sanctum session (see
[architecture.md § Authentication](architecture.md#authentication)).

Conventions used throughout:
- **List endpoints** support pagination (`?page=`, `?per_page=`), filtering
  and sorting via `spatie/laravel-query-builder` (`?filter[status]=active`,
  `?sort=-created_at`), and return `meta.pagination`.
- Authorization on every route is enforced by a Policy — the tables below
  note the permission each action maps to (see [rbac.md](rbac.md)), but the
  actual denial is a 403 from the Policy, not a route-level check.
- Row-level scoping (a Teacher only seeing their section, a Parent only
  their children) applies transparently on top of the permission check —
  see [rbac.md § Row-level scoping](rbac.md#row-level-scoping-own-vs-all).

## Auth

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/login` | `{ email_or_username, password, remember? }`. Throttled 10/min. |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Ends the session. |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Current user (`UserResource`, includes `permissions`). |
| PUT | `/auth/password` | Change own password (`current_password`, `password`). |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | Throttled 5/min. |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | Throttled 5/min. |
| POST | `/auth/email/verification-notification` | Resend verification email. Throttled 6/min. |
| GET | `/auth/email/verify/{id}/{hash}` | Signed URL, verifies email. |

## Two-factor authentication

Mandatory for every account — see [mfa.md](mfa.md) for the full picture
(enforcement, grace period, recovery).

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/login` | None | Now returns `{ mfa_required: true, challenge_token }` instead of the user, if the account already has MFA confirmed — no session is established yet. |
| POST | `/auth/mfa/verify-challenge` | None (guest) | `{ challenge_token, code }` — `code` may be a TOTP code or a recovery code. Completes the actual login, returns `UserResource` exactly like a non-MFA `/auth/login` would. Throttled 10/min. |
| POST | `/auth/mfa/setup` | Session | Generates a fresh unconfirmed secret, returns `{ secret, qr_code }` (a base64 PNG data URI). Calling again before confirming discards the pending secret. |
| POST | `/auth/mfa/confirm` | Session | `{ code }` — verifies against the pending secret, confirms MFA, returns `{ recovery_codes: [...] }` **once**. |
| POST | `/auth/mfa/recovery-codes/regenerate` | Session | `{ password }` — password-confirmed. Invalidates the old recovery codes, returns a fresh set. |

## Public

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/settings/public` | No auth. Returns `is_public=true` settings — powers pre-login branding and this deployment's school identity. |

## Dashboard

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/dashboard/summary` | Role-aware. Returns `role_context: 'staff'\|'teacher'\|'parent'` plus counts relevant to that context (see `DashboardService`). |

## Users & access control

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/users` | `users.view` | Filterable/sortable, scoped to caller's school. |
| POST | `/users` | `users.create` | |
| GET | `/users/{user}` | `users.view` | |
| PUT | `/users/{user}` | `users.edit` | |
| DELETE | `/users/{user}` | `users.delete` | Soft delete. |
| POST | `/users/{user}/roles` | `users.edit` | Replaces the user's role set. |
| POST | `/users/{user}/status` | `users.edit` | Activate/suspend/etc. |
| POST | `/users/{user}/reset-password` | `users.edit` | Admin-triggered reset. |
| POST | `/users/{user}/mfa/reset` | `users.manage-mfa` | Clears the user's TOTP enrollment entirely and grants a new 3-day setup grace period — see [mfa.md](mfa.md#lost-device--recovery). Deliberately its own permission, not `users.edit` (which also allows self-service — resetting your own MFA with no second factor would defeat the point). |
| GET | `/users/import/template` | `users.import` | Downloadable `.xlsx` template — `first_name, last_name, email, role, phone, designation_name, employee_id, hire_date`. No password column — see below. |
| POST | `/users/import` | `users.import` | `{ file, dry_run? }`. Bulk staff creation. Deliberately never accepts a password: every imported account gets a random, never-exposed password plus an immediate password-reset email (same mechanism as `POST /users/{user}/reset-password`). Every row's role assignment is checked through `UserPolicy::create()` exactly like `POST /users` — including its guard against granting "School Admin" without `roles.edit` — so `users.import` (held by HR Staff) can't be used to bypass that privilege-escalation control. `dry_run: true` runs every check (duplicates, role existence/permission, designation lookup) without writing anything, returning the same `{ imported_count, failed_count, failures, dry_run }` shape the real import does — the Import Center's preview-before-commit step. |
| GET/POST | `/roles` | `roles.view` / `roles.create` | |
| GET/PUT/DELETE | `/roles/{role}` | `roles.view`/`edit`/`delete` | |
| GET | `/permissions` | `roles.view` | Full permission catalogue, for the role editor's matrix. |

## Settings & audit

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/settings` | `settings.view` | All settings visible to caller (global + school). |
| PUT | `/settings` | `settings.edit` | Bulk upsert `{ settings: [{key, value}, ...] }`. |
| GET | `/audit-logs` | `audit-logs.view` | Filterable by causer/subject/date. |
| GET | `/import-logs` | `audit-logs.view` | One row per bulk-import attempt, dry runs included — `filter[entity]`/`filter[dry_run]`. Written by `App\Support\ImportLogger`, called from every import controller (lookup entities, students, staff). Reuses `audit-logs.view` rather than a new permission — this is the same kind of thing, just scoped to imports. Each row also carries `status` (`queued`/`processing`/`completed`/`failed` — every import except a large student one is created already `completed`), `failure_reason`, `failures`/`warnings` (the same shape the synchronous response used to only return once, never persisted — now stored on the log itself so a queued import's result can be read back after the fact), `undone_at`, and `can_undo` — see the Undo row below. |
| GET | `/import-logs/{importLog}` | `audit-logs.view` | Single-row fetch — same `ImportLogResource` shape as above. What `ImportForm` polls every 2s while a queued student import is `queued`/`processing`. |
| POST | `/import-logs/{importLog}/undo` | `audit-logs.manage` | Reverses an import via `App\Support\ImportUndoService` — soft-deletes exactly the records that import *created* (never a record it only updated — see `SimpleLookupImport::createdModels()` / the `import_log_items` table `App\Support\ImportLogger` writes alongside each log). A record is skipped (not deleted) if anything outside the import now depends on it (e.g. a Department that's since had a Subject added under it); the response reports `{ deleted, blocked: [{type, id, label}] }` and the attempt is recorded either way via `undone_at`, so a partially-blocked undo isn't retried forever. Refuses a dry-run log (nothing was written) or a log already undone (422). Deliberately scoped to the five lookup-table imports (Departments, Grade Levels, Sections, Subjects, Rooms) — Students/Staff/Guardians imports have richer dependent graphs and business logic that need their own undo design, so `can_undo` is always `false` for those. Split into its own `audit-logs.manage` permission, separate from `audit-logs.view`, since this deletes data (School Admin only by default — see `docs/rbac.md`). |
| POST | `/import-preview` | authenticated only | `{ file }` → `{ headers: string[], rows: string[][], truncated: bool }` — entity-agnostic, reads back an uploaded file's own header row and data rows exactly as they are, via a bare `Excel::toArray(new class {}, $file)` (no `WithHeadingRow`, so nothing is assumed about column names). Writes nothing and isn't gated by a specific import permission — it only ever echoes back a file the caller themselves just uploaded, so there's no other user's data to protect, just the same file-type/size validation and 2000-row cap (`ImportFilePreviewController::MAX_ROWS`, matching `CapsImportRows`) every real import already enforces against the same single-request-parse DoS shape. This is step one of the frontend's "Upload & map columns" mode (`ImportFileMapper`): the response's headers get fuzzy-matched against an entity's canonical columns (`guessColumnMapping`, confirmed by the user before anything is imported), then the mapped rows flow into the same grid review step `ImportForm`'s "Paste data" mode uses — nothing here talks to a specific entity's Import class at all. |

## Data export (Phase 15)

Both flows share `App\Jobs\GenerateDataExportJob` — the first real queued
job in this app (`QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`, see
[deployment.md](deployment.md) §5) — and produce a ZIP of CSVs, one per
resource. Self-service reuses the same `scopeVisibleTo()` scopes the UI
already uses (`Student`/`Guardian`/`Invoice`/`Payment`), zero new
authorization logic.

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/account/data-export` | None (self-service) | Starts generating the caller's own visible data (account/student-or-guardian profile/invoices/payments). |
| GET | `/account/data-export` | None (self-service) | Lists the caller's own past requests. |
| POST | `/data-exports` | `data-export.school` | Starts generating every record in the school (users/students/guardians/invoices/payments). |
| GET | `/data-exports` | `data-export.school` | Lists every school-wide export request. |
| GET | `/data-exports/{export}/download` | Owner (self scope) or `data-export.school` (school scope) | Streams the ZIP. 409 if not yet `ready`, 410 if the file has since been cleaned up (a `retention.data_export_days` setting controls how long, default 7). |

## Account deletion & anonymization (Phase 15)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DELETE | `/account` | Self-service — no permission gate, same self-service shape as `PUT /auth/password`. Anonymizes the caller's own PII (`AnonymizationService`) and soft-deletes their account immediately, then logs them out. No confirmation workflow beyond the request itself in v1. |
| DELETE | `/users/{user}` | `users.delete` (existing, unchanged permission) — now anonymizes before soft-deleting, not just a bare soft-delete. Restoring a soft-deleted user brings back an anonymized shell, not their original data — see [rbac.md](rbac.md). |

`AnonymizationService::anonymizeUser()` draws the PII line per model — see
its own docblock for exactly what's scrubbed vs. retained (a `Student`'s
academic identity/records survive even when their login account doesn't;
`Invoice`/`Payment`/`CreditNote`/`Payslip` are never touched at all,
financial/legal record).

## Academic structure

| Method | Path | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/academic-years[/{id}]` | `academic-years.*` |
| POST | `/academic-years/{academicYear}/activate` | `academic-years.edit` — marks `is_current`, deactivates the previous current year |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/terms[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/departments[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET | `/departments/import/template` | `academic-structure.import` — downloadable `.xlsx` template (`name, code, description`) |
| POST | `/departments/import` | `academic-structure.import` — `{ file, dry_run?, mode? }`, via the shared `SimpleLookupImport`/`LookupImportController` base every plain lookup-table import (departments/grade-levels/sections/subjects/rooms) is built on. `mode` is one of `create` (default — rejects an existing code), `update` (only touches an existing match, fails the row if none), or `upsert` (create-or-update). Response adds `updated_count` alongside `imported_count`/`failed_count`/`failures`/`dry_run`. Every attempt (dry runs included) is written to `import_logs` — see `GET /import-logs` below. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/grade-levels[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET | `/grade-levels/import/template` | `academic-structure.import` — template: `name, code, sequence` |
| POST | `/grade-levels/import` | `academic-structure.import` — `{ file, dry_run? }` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/sections[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET | `/sections/import/template` | `academic-structure.import` — template: `grade_level_code, name, capacity, room_code`. No `class_teacher` column — assigning one stays a separate step after the section exists, matching `docs/school-setup-guide.md`'s own phase split. |
| POST | `/sections/import` | `academic-structure.import` — `{ file, dry_run? }`. Not built on the plain `SimpleLookupImport` single-column-key default like departments/grade-levels/subjects/rooms: a section's real uniqueness is composite (`academic_year_id` + `grade_level_id` + `name`, matching the DB constraint), so `SectionsImport` overrides `uniqueKey()` directly. Sections are created in whichever academic year is currently `is_current`; 422s if none is set. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/subjects[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET | `/subjects/import/template` | `academic-structure.import` — template: `name, code, department_code, is_elective`. `department_code` is optional and resolved against `departments.code`, not a raw `department_id` — fails that row (not the whole file) if it doesn't match an existing department. |
| POST | `/subjects/import` | `academic-structure.import` — `{ file, dry_run? }` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/rooms[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET | `/rooms/import/template` | `academic-structure.import` — template: `name, code, capacity, type` (`type` defaults to `classroom` when blank) |
| POST | `/rooms/import` | `academic-structure.import` — `{ file, dry_run? }` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/holidays[/{id}]` | `academic-structure.*` |
| GET/POST | `/class-subject-teachers` | `academic-structure.view`/`create` — assigns a teacher to a subject within a section |
| DELETE | `/class-subject-teachers/{id}` | `academic-structure.delete` |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/timetable-periods[/{id}]` | `timetable.*` — the reusable time-slot definitions (Period 1: 08:00-08:45, ...) |
| GET | `/timetable` | `timetable.view` | Grid view: entries for a section/teacher/week. |
| POST/PUT/DELETE | `/timetable-entries[/{id}]` | `timetable.create`/`edit`/`delete` — rejects teacher double-booking (see [database.md](database.md#key-modeling-decisions)) |

## Students

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/students` | `students.view` | Row-scoped (Teacher → own sections, Class Teacher → own section). |
| POST | `/students` | `students.create` | Admission — creates the student, generates `admission_number`, optionally creates guardians inline, writes an `admission` enrollment-history row. |
| GET | `/students/{student}` | `students.view` | |
| PUT | `/students/{student}` | `students.edit` | |
| DELETE | `/students/{student}` | `students.delete` | Soft delete. |
| GET | `/students/import/template` | `students.import` | Downloads a blank Excel template — student fields plus two optional guardian slots (`guardian1_*`/`guardian2_*`: first/last name, email, phone, relationship, is_primary, can_pickup). A guardian matched by email to an existing one is reused rather than duplicated, so siblings can share a row across guardians. |
| POST | `/students/import` | `students.import` | `{ file, dry_run? }`. Bulk admission via Excel; per-row validation, partial success reporting. `dry_run: true` validates and resolves every row (grade/section lookup included) without creating anything — same response shape, `imported_count` means "would import." Response also includes `warnings: [{row, message}]` — a row whose name closely matches (≥82% `similar_text()`) an existing student with the *same date of birth* is flagged as a possible duplicate but still imported, never auto-merged or blocked (`StudentsImport::checkForPossibleDuplicate()`) — a human reviews it after the fact. **Large files run in the background**: a real commit (`dry_run` false) whose uploaded file exceeds `StudentImportController::ASYNC_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (256 KB) is stored, an `import_logs` row is created with `status: queued`, and `App\Jobs\ProcessStudentImportJob` is dispatched to the queue worker instead of running inline — the endpoint responds `202` with `{ queued: true, import_log_id }` immediately rather than the usual result shape. Poll `GET /import-logs/{id}` (below) until `status` is `completed`/`failed`; the frontend's `ImportForm` does this automatically. A dry-run preview is never queued regardless of size, since nothing is written and the point of a preview is seeing it immediately. Requires a real queue worker process — see `docs/deployment.md` §5. |
| GET | `/students/export` | `students.export` | Excel export of the (filtered) student list. |
| POST | `/students/bulk/promote` | `enrollment.manage` | Promotes a set of student IDs to a target grade/section together. |
| GET/POST/DELETE | `/students/{student}/documents[/{media}]` | `students.edit` | Upload/list/delete via medialibrary collections (`photo`, `birth_certificate`, `previous_report_card`, `transfer_certificate`, `other`). |
| POST/PUT/DELETE | `/students/{student}/guardians[/{guardian}]` | `students.edit` | Attach/update/detach a guardian link (relationship type, primary flag, pickup permission). |
| GET | `/students/{student}/enrollment-history` | `students.view` | Full timeline of admission/promotion/transfer/withdrawal/graduation/reactivation. |
| POST | `/students/{student}/promote` | `enrollment.manage` | |
| POST | `/students/{student}/transfer` | `enrollment.manage` | |
| POST | `/students/{student}/withdraw` | `enrollment.manage` | |
| POST | `/students/{student}/graduate` | `enrollment.manage` | |
| POST | `/students/{student}/reactivate` | `enrollment.manage` | |
| POST | `/students/{student}/invite-portal-user` | `students.edit` | Creates a `User` (Student role) and links it via `students.user_id`. |

## Guardians & Parent Portal

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/guardians` | `guardians.view` | |
| GET | `/guardians/import/template` | `guardians.import` | Downloadable `.xlsx` template — `student_admission_number, first_name, last_name, email, phone, relationship_type, is_primary, can_pickup`. |
| POST | `/guardians/import` | `guardians.import` | `{ file, dry_run?, mode? }`. Not a standalone-entity import like departments/rooms — every row *links* a guardian to a student already in the system, resolved by `student_admission_number` (404s that row, not the file, if it doesn't match). A guardian matched by `email` to one already in the system is reused rather than duplicated (same sibling-sharing behavior as `/students/import`'s guardian slots). `mode` (`create`/`update`/`upsert`, default `create`) governs the student↔guardian *link*, not the Guardian row itself — `create` rejects a link that already exists, `update` requires one to already exist, `upsert` does either. Returns `{ imported_count, updated_count, failed_count, failures, dry_run, mode }`, logged to `import_logs` like every other import. |
| GET | `/guardians/{guardian}` | `guardians.view` | |
| POST | `/guardians/{guardian}/invite` | `guardians.edit` | Creates a `User` (Parent role) and links it via `guardians.user_id`. |
| GET | `/parent/children` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | Children linked to the authenticated user's `Guardian` record — never trusts a client-supplied guardian ID. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/profile` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | 403s if `{student}` isn't actually linked to the caller. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/attendance` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | `?from=&to=` (default: current month). Returns `{ summary, records }`. Never gated behind `student-attendance.view` — works even if a School Admin edits the Parent role's permissions (see [rbac.md](rbac.md#frontend-permission-checks)). |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/exams` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | Published exams touching the child's current section. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/report-card` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | `?exam_id=`. Same shape as the staff report-card endpoint below. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/report-card/pdf` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | `?exam_id=`. Dedicated parent-portal PDF route (not the staff one) — same rationale as the other parent endpoints: never depends on `exams.view`/`exam-marks.view`. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/term-result` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | `?term_id=`. |

## Attendance

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/attendance/students` | `student-attendance.view` | Row-scoped (Teacher/Class Teacher → own sections, Student → self, Parent → own children). Filterable by `section_id`, `student_id`, `date`, `status`, `timetable_period_id`. |
| POST | `/attendance/students` | `student-attendance.mark` | Bulk mark: `{ section_id, date, timetable_period_id?, entries: [{student_id, status, remarks?}] }`. `timetable_period_id: null` = whole-day. Upserts — resubmitting the same section/date/period corrects existing rows instead of duplicating. Teacher/Class Teacher restricted to a section they actually teach (403 otherwise, checked server-side regardless of what the UI shows). |
| PUT | `/attendance/students/{studentAttendance}` | `student-attendance.edit` | Single-record correction: `{ status, remarks? }`. |
| GET | `/attendance/students/summary` | *(via `view` on the target Student)* | `?student_id=&from=&to=` (default: current month). Returns `{ total_marked, present_equivalent, percentage, counts }` — see [database.md](database.md#key-modeling-decisions) for the percentage weighting rule. |
| GET | `/attendance/students/section-summary` | `student-attendance.view` | `?section_id=&date=&timetable_period_id=`. Same shape as above, for a whole section on one day. |
| GET | `/attendance/staff` | *(permissive — see note)* | Every authenticated non-Student/Parent user can call this; scoped to their own records unless they hold `staff-attendance.view`, in which case they see everyone's. Filterable by `user_id`, `date`, `status`. |
| POST | `/attendance/staff` | `staff-attendance.mark` | Bulk mark others' attendance: `{ date, entries: [{user_id, status, remarks?}] }`. |
| POST | `/attendance/staff/check-in` | *(any staff, self only)* | Marks the caller Present with `check_in_time = now()`. Upserts today's row. |
| POST | `/attendance/staff/check-out` | *(any staff, self only)* | Sets `check_out_time` on today's row. 422 if the caller hasn't checked in yet. |
| PUT | `/attendance/staff/{staffAttendance}` | `staff-attendance.edit` | Single-record correction. |
| GET | `/attendance/staff/summary` | *(self, or `staff-attendance.view` for others)* | `?user_id=&from=&to=` (default: current month; `user_id` defaults to caller). |

**A note on `date` filters:** every date-range/exact-date query in this module goes through `whereDate()`, never a plain string comparison — Eloquent's `date` cast writes a full `Y-m-d H:i:s` value on SQLite (only MySQL's native `DATE` column type truncates the time part on write), so `?filter[date]=2026-08-08` against a raw string-equality filter silently matches nothing. This bit four separate call sites once (see `AttendanceService`'s docblock) before being fixed uniformly — don't reintroduce a plain `where('date', $string)` anywhere in this module.

## Grading & Examinations

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/grading-scales[/{id}]` | `grading.view` / `grading.manage` | `{ name, is_default?, grade_bands: [{min_percentage, max_percentage, grade_label, grade_point?, remark?}] }`. Bands are always replaced wholesale on update. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/exam-types[/{id}]` | `grading.view` / `grading.manage` | Phase 16. `{ name, code, sequence?, is_active? }`. Class Test/Trimester/Final/etc. — configurable, seeded with a canonical set by `ExamConfigSeeder`. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/assessment-component-types[/{id}]` | `grading.view` / `grading.manage` | Phase 16. `{ name, code, is_auto_graded?, sequence?, is_active? }`. Online MCQ/Written/Practical/Oral, etc. — `is_auto_graded` drives whether the frontend shows online-test scheduling fields when adding a component of this type. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/exams[/{id}]` | `exams.*` | Row-scoped like attendance (see [rbac.md](rbac.md#row-level-scoping-own-vs-all)) — `index`/`show` are overridden from the generic CRUD controller specifically for this. `{ academic_year_id, term_id?, exam_type_id?, name, weight?, exam_subject_groups?: [{subject_id, section_id, grading_scale_id?, passing_marks?, components: [{assessment_component_type_id, max_marks, exam_date?, is_online?, duration_minutes?, online_starts_at?, online_ends_at?, shuffle_questions?, max_attempts?}]}] }`. Phase 16 nested this — each subject can now carry multiple gradable components (Online MCQ + Written + Oral + Practical) instead of one flat mark. Groups are upserted by `(subject_id, section_id)`, components within a group by `assessment_component_type_id` — never wholesale-replaced, same rationale as before: an unrelated edit to the exam's name must not risk cascading away already-entered marks. |
| DELETE | `/exams/{exam}/exam-subject-groups/{group}/components/{examSubject}` | `exams.edit` | Phase 16, replaces the old `.../exam-subjects/{id}` route. The explicit, separate way to remove one component (and cascade its marks) — never happens implicitly via a PUT to `/exams/{exam}`. |
| POST | `/exams/{exam}/publish` | `exams.publish` | Sets `is_published = true`, stamps `published_at`, and (Phase 16) stamps `published_at`/`published_by` on every `exam_subject_group` under the exam too — the whole-exam bulk action, still means "publish everything." |
| POST | `/exams/{exam}/unpublish` | `exams.publish` | Also clears every subject group's `published_at`/`published_by`. |
| POST | `/exams/{exam}/exam-subject-groups/{group}/publish` | `exam-marks.publish` | Phase 16. Declares just this one subject's result early, independent of the whole exam — Admin/Principal always, otherwise only the class teacher of the group's own section (see [rbac.md](rbac.md#permission-catalogue)). Returns the group's `SubjectResultRow` (see below). |
| POST | `/exams/{exam}/exam-subject-groups/{group}/unpublish` | `exam-marks.publish` | Same authorization as publish. |
| GET | `/exams/{exam}/exam-subject-groups/{group}/result` | *(via `view` on the target Student)* | `?student_id=`. The combined component breakdown + total for one subject group — same `SubjectResultRow` shape a Student/Parent sees once declared, used by staff to preview it beforehand. |
| GET | `/exams/{exam}/report-card` | *(via `view` on the target Student)* | `?student_id=`. **No longer 403s an unpublished exam for Student/Parent** (Phase 16) — always 200 for the caller's own record, with per-subject masking doing the real work: a subject whose group isn't yet declared (`Exam.is_published` false AND that group's own `published_at` unset) comes back with only `{status}`, every mark/percentage/grade null. `subjects[]` rows are the same `SubjectResultRow` shape as the group-result endpoint above — one calculation (`SubjectResultService`), never duplicated. |
| GET | `/exams/{exam}/report-card/pdf` | Same as above | Same data, rendered via `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` and streamed as a download — now includes a per-component breakdown sub-table and a Pass/Fail column. |
| GET | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/marks` | `exam-marks.view` | Row-scoped like attendance/exams. `examSubject` here is one *component* (Phase 16) — a multi-component subject has one of these calls per component, each with its own roster of `ExamMark` rows. |
| POST | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/marks` | `exam-marks.enter` | Bulk mark: `{ entries: [{student_id, marks_obtained?, is_absent?, remarks?}] }`. Upserts. Teacher/Class Teacher restricted to a subject they're the assigned `ClassSubjectTeacher` for (403 otherwise) — a *stricter* check than attendance's, since it's subject-level not section-level (a Class Teacher can view every subject in their section but only grade ones they personally teach). |
| PUT | `/exam-marks/{examMark}` | `exam-marks.edit` | Single-record correction. |
| GET | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/marks/import/template` | `exam-marks.import` | Downloadable `.xlsx` template — `admission_number, marks_obtained, is_absent, remarks`. |
| POST | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/marks/import` | `exam-marks.import` | An alternative to the manual roster form above for bulk-entering a whole section's marks at once. Same `assertSubjectMarkable()` authorization as the manual endpoint. Students are matched by `admission_number` within the component's own section; an unresolvable admission number, an in-file duplicate, or a mark exceeding the component's `max_marks` soft-fails that row (`ExamMarksImport`, mirrors `McqQuestionsImport`'s per-row `Failure` pattern) rather than aborting the file. Valid rows are handed to the same `ExamService::markBulk()` upsert the manual endpoint uses — re-importing the same student updates their mark, never duplicates it. Returns `{ imported_count, failed_count, failures: [{row, attribute, errors}], dry_run }`. `dry_run: true` (an added request field) validates every row without calling `markBulk()`. |
| GET | `/terms/{term}/result` | *(via `view` on the target Student)* | `?student_id=`. Weighted average across every published exam in the term the student has marks for, plus section rank — see `TermResultService` in [database.md](database.md#key-modeling-decisions). Deliberately still gated on `Exam.is_published` only, not per-subject-group status — a bounded Phase 16 scope decision, not an oversight. |
| GET | `/terms/{term}/result/pdf` | Same as above | Phase 16 — new. The JSON aggregation already existed; this closes the "no PDF for the consolidated result" gap. |

### Question bank & online examinations

Auto-graded MCQ/True-False tests — see [database.md § Exams, grading &
online tests](database.md#exams-grading--online-tests) for how these tables
relate. A "test" isn't its own resource; it's just an `ExamSubject` with
`is_online: true` plus a set of attached questions. There's no standalone
"Question Bank" page in the frontend — question create/edit/delete/Excel
-import all live inline on `OnlineTestConfigPage.tsx`.

Questions are scoped to the specific test they were authored for, not
shared across every test on the same subject: `GET
/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/online-test-questions` only returns questions
actually attached (via `OnlineTestQuestion`) to that one `ExamSubject`, so a
freshly configured test starts empty until something is created or imported
directly into it. `POST /questions` and `POST /questions/import` both
accept an optional `exam_subject_id` — when present, the created/imported
question(s) are attached to that test immediately (append, not replace),
gated by the same "must be the assigned subject teacher, unless
Admin/Principal" rule `online-test-questions` (POST) already enforces. The
generic `/questions[/{id}]`/`import` endpoints themselves still work
without `exam_subject_id` (e.g. editing/deleting a question already
attached elsewhere) — only the *creation* path gained the optional attach.

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/questions[/{id}]` | `questions.*` | `{ subject_id?, exam_subject_id?, type: 'mcq'\|'true_false', text, default_marks?, explanation?, options: [{option_text, is_correct}] }`. Exactly one option must be `is_correct`; True/False requires exactly 2 options. Options are replaced wholesale on update (see the "accepted limitation" note in [database.md](database.md#exams-grading--online-tests)). `exam_subject_id` (create only) attaches the new question straight into that test. |
| GET | `/questions/import/template` | `questions.import` | Downloadable `.xlsx` template. |
| POST | `/questions/import` | `questions.import` | `{ file, subject_id, exam_subject_id?, dry_run? }`. With `exam_subject_id`, every successfully imported row is attached to that test. `dry_run: true` validates every row (duplicate text, option/correct_option consistency) without creating anything. |
| GET | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/online-test-questions` | `online-exams.configure` | This test's currently attached questions, full teacher-facing detail (`is_correct`/`explanation` included — unlike the student-facing `TestQuestionResource` used by `/attempts`). Empty for a test nothing has been attached to yet. |
| POST | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/online-test-questions` | `online-exams.configure` | `{ questions: [{question_id, marks?}] }`. Replaces the test's question set wholesale (safe even with existing attempts — see [database.md](database.md#exams-grading--online-tests)). Teacher/Class Teacher must be the assigned subject teacher, same rule as marks entry. Superseded as the frontend's primary flow by the create/import auto-attach above, but kept and still tested — a valid bulk-replace primitive. |
| GET | `/online-tests/mine` | *(Student, self-scoped)* | Every online-mode `ExamSubject` for the caller's own section, **regardless of the parent exam's publish state** — a test must be taken to produce the marks an exam gets published with, so this deliberately doesn't route through `Exam::scopeVisibleTo()`. Returns an attempt summary per test including `result_declared: boolean`; `best_score`/`max_score` are `null` until that subject's group is actually declared (same rule as the submit/show masking below), not merely once a score exists. |
| POST | `/exam-subjects/{examSubject}/attempts` | *(Student, self-scoped)* | Starts (or resumes an in-progress) attempt. 422 if not enrolled in the section, outside the `online_starts_at`/`online_ends_at` window, or `max_attempts` exhausted — resuming an already-started attempt is never blocked by the attempt cap. Returns `{ attempt, duration_minutes, questions }`, questions sanitized (no answer key) via a dedicated resource, shuffled per-student if `shuffle_questions`. |
| PUT | `/online-test-attempts/{attempt}/answers` | *(Student, own attempt only)* | `{ question_id, selected_option_id }`. Autosave, one call per question. 422 once the attempt is submitted. |
| POST | `/online-test-attempts/{attempt}/submit` | *(Student, own attempt only)* | Grades every question and writes the score into the exam's official `exam_marks` row immediately (`entered_by` = the student themselves, `remarks: 'Auto-graded via online test.'`) — but the response only includes `score`/`max_score`/`answers` (the full answer-by-answer breakdown with correct answers and `explanation`) once that subject's `ExamSubjectGroup` is actually declared (`status() === 'published'`, or the whole exam is), same Draft/Calculated/Published rule every other component type already follows. Before that, the response still confirms `status: 'submitted'`/`submitted_at`, just without the graded fields — see `OnlineTestAttemptResource`. |
| GET | `/online-test-attempts/{attempt}` | Own attempt, or `exam-marks.view` for non-Student/Parent staff | Same shape and same masking as the submit response — a staff viewer with `exam-marks.view` (excluding Student/Parent) always sees the graded fields regardless of publish state; a Student re-fetching their own attempt does not. `exam-marks.view` alone isn't a safe staff check here since Students hold it too (for their own marks) — see `OnlineTestController::authorizeOwnAttempt()`'s docblock. |

## Teacher module: homework & remarks (Phase 7)

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/homework[/{id}]` | `homework.*` | Row-scoped like exams — `index`/`show` overridden for this. `{ academic_year_id, section_id, subject_id, title, description?, due_date, max_score? }`. `teacher_id` is always the creating user, not client-supplied. Teacher/Class Teacher restricted to a subject they're the assigned `ClassSubjectTeacher` for on create/edit/delete (403 otherwise) — School Admin unrestricted. For a Student/Parent caller, each row's `my_submission` is eager-loaded and included inline. |
| POST | `/homework/{homework}/attachments` | `homework.edit` | `multipart/form-data`, `{ file }`. Same ownership check as edit/delete. |
| DELETE | `/homework/{homework}/attachments/{media}` | `homework.edit` | |
| GET | `/homework/{homework}/submissions` | `homework.grade` bypass roles, or the assigned teacher | The teacher's roster view: every student currently in the section, joined with their submission if one exists — not just a list of submissions, so "who hasn't submitted yet" is visible directly. |
| POST | `/homework/{homework}/submit` | *(Student, self-scoped)* | `multipart/form-data`, `{ content?, file? }`. Upserts on `(homework_id, student_id)` — resubmitting before grading replaces the previous content/attachment. 403 if the homework isn't assigned to the caller's current section. |
| PUT | `/homework-submissions/{submission}/grade` | `homework.grade` | `{ score?, feedback? }`. Sets `status = graded`, stamps `graded_at`/`graded_by`. Same subject-ownership check as creating the homework. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/student-remarks[/{id}]` | `remarks.*` | Row-scoped — `filter[student_id]` is how the Student Profile/Parent Portal tabs scope this to one student. `{ student_id, category?, body, visible_to_guardian? }`. Teacher/Class Teacher restricted to a student currently in a section they teach or lead (reuses `Student::scopeVisibleTo()`), checked on create/update/delete. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/homework` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | Homework for the child's current section, each row's own submission (if any) included — same rationale as the other parent-portal endpoints: never depends on the staff permission matrix. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/remarks` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | Only remarks with `visible_to_guardian = true`. |

## Fees / Billing / Accounting (Phase 8)

School-to-parent fee billing. `fees` covers billing config (categories,
structures); `invoices` covers the transactional side (invoices, payments,
credit notes, reports).

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/fee-categories[/{id}]` | `fees.*` | Plain CRUD. `{ name, description?, is_active? }`, unique per school. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/fee-structures[/{id}]` | `fees.*` | Billing templates. `{ academic_year_id, grade_level_id?, fee_category_id, name, amount, frequency, due_day_of_month?, is_active? }`. `grade_level_id` null = applies school-wide. `frequency` is informational (`one_time\|monthly\|quarterly\|term\|annual`) — v1 has no recurring-billing scheduler; each period is billed via a manual "Generate Invoices" action. |
| POST | `/fee-structures/{feeStructure}/generate-invoices` | `invoices.create` | `{ section_id?, issue_date, due_date }`. Bulk-creates one invoice per active student matching the structure's grade (optionally narrowed to one section), applying that student's `StudentFeeAssignment` discount if one exists. Idempotent — a student who already has a non-void invoice carrying an item for this exact structure is skipped, not double-billed. One transaction per student, not one around the whole batch — see `InvoiceService::generateFromStructure()`'s docblock and [testing.md](testing.md#manualbrowser-smoke-testing) for why that matters here specifically. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/student-fee-assignments[/{id}]` | `fees.*` | Per-student discount/scholarship against a fee structure. `{ student_id, fee_structure_id, discount_type: none\|percentage\|fixed, discount_value?, reason? }`. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/invoices[/{id}]` | `invoices.*` | Row-scoped like homework/exams — `index`/`show` apply `Invoice::scopeVisibleTo()` so Student/Parent only ever see their own/their child's invoices. `store`: `{ student_id, academic_year_id, issue_date, due_date, notes?, items: [{ fee_category_id, fee_structure_id?, description, quantity?, unit_amount }] }` — an ad-hoc invoice, always created `issued` (no draft workflow in v1). `update`: `{ due_date?, notes? }` only. `destroy` is blocked (422) once any payment exists — void it instead. |
| POST | `/invoices/{invoice}/void` | `invoices.void` | Blocked (422) if `amount_paid > 0` — an invoice with payments must be credited, not voided, so the payment ledger stays meaningful. |
| POST | `/invoices/{invoice}/payments` | `invoices.record-payment` | `{ amount, method: cash\|cheque\|bank_transfer\|upi\|card\|other, reference_number?, paid_at, notes? }`. Delegates the actual recording to `PaymentGatewayInterface` (only a `manual` implementation ships — see below), then recalculates the invoice's `amount_paid`/`status`. Rejects (422) an amount exceeding the current balance. |
| POST | `/invoices/{invoice}/credit-notes` | `invoices.issue-credit-note` | `{ amount, reason }`. Reduces balance without touching `amount_paid` (a refund/write-off, not a payment). Rejects (422) an amount exceeding the balance. |
| GET | `/students/{student}/fee-statement` | *(via Student's own policy)* | Every invoice for a student with running totals (`total_billed`/`total_paid`/`total_credited`/`total_outstanding`) — backs the Student Profile's "Fees" tab. |
| GET | `/payments` | `invoices.view` | School-wide payments ledger for reconciliation, row-scoped the same way as invoices for a Student/Parent caller (though neither reaches this endpoint from the UI — they read payments via their own invoice). |
| GET | `/payments/{payment}/receipt` | *(via Payment's own policy)* | JSON receipt data. |
| GET | `/payments/{payment}/receipt/pdf` | *(via Payment's own policy)* | Same `Pdf::loadView(...)->download()` pattern as exam report cards. |
| GET | `/fee-reports/collection-summary` | `invoices.view-reports` | `?from_date&to_date` (defaults to the current month). Total collected, by payment method, by fee category. |
| GET | `/fee-reports/outstanding-dues` | `invoices.view-reports` | Total outstanding, overdue count, breakdown by grade level. |
| GET | `/parent/children/{student}/invoices` | *(Parent role, self-scoped)* | Same statement shape as the student fee-statement endpoint — the Parent Portal's "Fees" tab renders identically to the Student Profile's. |

**Payment gateway.** `App\Contracts\PaymentGatewayInterface` is the seam between "an invoice got money against it" and how that money was actually collected. `App\Services\Payments\ManualPaymentGateway` (cash/cheque/bank-transfer/UPI/card recorded by staff after the fact — no external charge) is the only implementation Phase 8 ships, bound via `config/payments.php`. A real online gateway (Stripe, Razorpay, PayU, ...) is a deliberate future integration — per `docs/roadmap.md`'s cross-cutting decisions, the first concrete non-manual implementation is a pause-and-confirm-with-the-user checkpoint, not something to guess at. Swapping one in later is a container-binding change in `AppServiceProvider`, not a rewrite of anything that calls the interface.

## Staff / HR (Phase 9)

Designations are a plain lookup CRUD (`fees`-module-style). Leave and payroll
both split the same way: config (leave types) needs no self-service
permission at all, day-to-day requests/payslips are self-scoped and
unpermissioned for the person they belong to, and `leave`/`payroll`'s
`view`/`manage` permissions only ever expand reach to *other* staff's
records — never gate a person's own.

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/designations[/{id}]` | `designations.*` | Plain CRUD — job titles (Math Teacher, Accountant, ...). `{ name, description?, is_active? }`. Assigned to a user via `PUT /users/{id}`'s `designation_id` field, not a dedicated endpoint. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/leave-types[/{id}]` | *(view: any staff member; create/edit/delete: `leave.manage`)* | Config — `{ name, days_allowed_per_year?, is_paid?, description?, is_active? }`. `viewAny` is deliberately unrestricted to any non-Student/Parent user: picking a leave type is the first step of filing your own leave request, so everyone needs read access to the catalog even though only HR/Admin can edit it — see `LeaveTypePolicy`. |
| GET | `/leave-requests` | *(any staff member; `leave.view` expands to every school)* | Self-scoped unless the caller holds `leave.view` — same shape as `GET /attendance/staff`. `filter[user_id]`/`filter[status]`/`filter[leave_type_id]` supported. |
| POST | `/leave-requests` | *(any staff member, self-scoped)* | `{ leave_type_id, start_date, end_date, reason }`. Always files for the caller — there's no "file on behalf of" in v1. `days` is computed server-side (inclusive date diff). |
| GET | `/leave-requests/{id}` | *(own record, or `leave.view` for another's)* | |
| POST | `/leave-requests/{leaveRequest}/cancel` | *(own record, only while `pending`)* | Withdrawing a request once it's been reviewed isn't allowed — ask HR to reverse the decision instead. |
| POST | `/leave-requests/{leaveRequest}/review` | `leave.manage` | `{ status: approved\|rejected, review_notes? }`. On approval, every day in the range is stamped `on_leave` on the staff member's `staff_attendances` (upserted via `AttendanceService::markOnLeave()`, correcting an already-marked day rather than duplicating it) — see [database.md](database.md#key-modeling-decisions). |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/salary-structures[/{id}]` | `payroll.*` | HR/Admin only end to end — unlike leave/payslips, there's no "view your own structure" self-service surface (a staff member sees the *result* via their payslips, not the structure itself). `{ user_id, basic_salary, allowances?, deductions?, effective_from }`. Creating a new structure for a user automatically closes their previous active one (`effective_to` set, `is_active = false`) rather than requiring a separate step. |
| GET | `/payslips` | *(any staff member; `payroll.view` expands to every school)* | Self-scoped unless the caller holds `payroll.view`/`payroll.manage` — same self-visibility shape as leave requests. `filter[user_id]`/`filter[status]`/`filter[year]`/`filter[month]`. |
| POST | `/payslips/generate` | `payroll.manage` | `{ month, year }`. One payslip per active `SalaryStructure` in the school, snapshotting its current amounts. Idempotent — a staff member who already has a payslip for that month/year is skipped. One transaction per staff member, not one around the whole batch — same lesson as Phase 8's bulk invoice generation, see `PayrollService::generateForMonth()`'s docblock. |
| POST | `/payslips/{id}/mark-paid` | `payroll.manage` | Rejects (422) if already `paid`. |
| GET | `/payslips/{payslip}/receipt` | *(own record, or `payroll.view`/`.manage` for another's)* | JSON payslip data. |
| GET | `/payslips/{payslip}/receipt/pdf` | *(same as above)* | Same `Pdf::loadView(...)->download()` pattern as fee receipts/report cards. |

## Library, Transport, Hostel & Front Desk (Phase 10)

Four independent sub-modules, each behind its own `view`/`manage`
permission — no separate create/edit/delete verbs (see
[rbac.md](rbac.md#permission-catalogue)). Plain-CRUD entities
(`Book`, `Vehicle`, `Route`, `Hostel`, `HostelRoom`) use the standard
`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE` shape; the rest are custom action endpoints.

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/books[/{id}]` | `library.*` | `{ title, author?, isbn?, category?, total_copies, is_active? }`. `store` sets `available_copies = total_copies`. `update` shifts `available_copies` by any change to `total_copies`, clamped at 0 — copies currently on loan stay accounted for even if `total_copies` shrinks below that count. |
| GET | `/book-issues` | `library.view` | `filter[book_id]`/`filter[student_id]`/`filter[user_id]`/`filter[status]`. |
| POST | `/books/{book}/issue` | `library.manage` | `{ student_id?, user_id?, due_date }` — exactly one of `student_id`/`user_id` (`required_without` + `prohibits`). Rejects (422) if `available_copies < 1`. |
| POST | `/book-issues/{id}/return` | `library.manage` | Computes `fine_amount` from `library.fine_per_day` (a DB-driven Setting) × days late past `due_date`, increments the book's `available_copies`. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/vehicles[/{id}]` | `transport.*` | `{ registration_number, capacity, driver_name?, driver_phone?, is_active? }`. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/routes[/{id}]` | `transport.*` | `{ name, description?, is_active?, stops?: [{ name, sequence? }] }`. `store` creates the route and its nested stops in one transaction. |
| POST | `/routes/{route}/stops` | `transport.manage` | `{ name, sequence? }`. Appends a stop to an existing route — `sequence` defaults to "one past the current count." |
| DELETE | `/routes/{route}/stops/{stop}` | `transport.manage` | |
| GET | `/student-transport-assignments` | `transport.view` | `filter[student_id]`/`filter[route_id]`/`filter[is_active]`. |
| POST | `/student-transport-assignments` | `transport.manage` | `{ student_id, route_id, route_stop_id, vehicle_id?, effective_from }`. Closes the student's previous active assignment (`is_active = false`) before creating the new one — same "close, don't delete" shape as `SalaryStructure`. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/hostels[/{id}]` | `hostel.*` | `{ name, type: boys\|girls\|mixed, address?, warden_name?, warden_phone?, is_active? }`. |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/hostel-rooms[/{id}]` | `hostel.*` | `{ hostel_id, room_number, capacity, is_active? }`. |
| GET | `/hostel-allocations` | `hostel.view` | `filter[student_id]`/`filter[hostel_room_id]`/`filter[status]`. |
| POST | `/hostel-allocations` | `hostel.manage` | `{ student_id, hostel_room_id, bed_number?, allocated_date }`. Rejects (422) if the room is already at capacity (`HostelRoom::occupiedCount() >= capacity`); otherwise closes the student's previous active allocation (`status = vacated`) before creating the new one, all in one transaction. |
| POST | `/hostel-allocations/{id}/vacate` | `hostel.manage` | Rejects (422) if already `vacated`. |
| GET | `/visitors` | `front-desk.view` | `filter[name]`/`filter[date]` (matches `check_in_time`)/`filter[status]` (`checked_in` = `check_out_time IS NULL`). |
| POST | `/visitors` | `front-desk.manage` | `{ name, phone?, purpose, whom_to_meet?, notes? }`. Stamps `check_in_time = now()` and `logged_by` server-side. |
| POST | `/visitors/{id}/check-out` | `front-desk.manage` | Rejects (422) if already checked out. |

## Certificates, ID Cards, Notice Board & Communication (Phase 11)

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/certificate-templates[/{id}]` | `certificates.*` | `{ name, type, body, is_active? }`. `body` supports `{{student_name}}`/`{{admission_number}}`/`{{grade_level}}`/`{{section}}`/`{{school_name}}`/`{{date}}` placeholders. |
| GET | `/certificates` | *(any staff holding `certificates.view`; Student/Parent self-scoped)* | Row-scoped like invoices — `Certificate::scopeVisibleTo()`. `filter[student_id]`/`filter[certificate_template_id]`. |
| GET | `/certificates/{id}` | *(own record, or `certificates.view` for another's)* | |
| POST | `/certificate-templates/{certificateTemplate}/issue` | `certificates.issue` | `{ student_id, issued_date? }`. Renders the template's placeholders against the student and stamps a sequential `certificate_number`. |
| GET | `/certificates/{id}/pdf` | *(same visibility as `GET /certificates/{id}`)* | |
| GET | `/students/{id}/id-card/pdf` | *(via `StudentPolicy::view`)* | Rendered live from the `Student` row every time — nothing is stored. QR code encodes the student's `uuid`. |
| GET | `/users/{id}/id-card/pdf` | *(via `UserPolicy::view` — self or `users.view`)* | Same shape, for staff. |
| GET | `/notices` | *(any authenticated user; `notice-board.view` expands to drafts)* | `Notice::scopeVisibleTo()` — published, non-expired, audience-matching for everyone else. `filter[type]`/`filter[audience]`/`filter[is_published]`. |
| GET | `/notices/{id}` | *(same visibility as the index)* | |
| POST/PUT/DELETE | `/notices[/{notice}]` | `notice-board.create`/`.edit`/`.delete` | `{ title, body, type?: general\|event, audience?: all\|students\|staff\|parents, event_date?, start_time?, end_time?, location?, expires_at? }`. Always created unpublished. |
| POST | `/notices/{notice}/publish` | `notice-board.publish` | Rejects (422) if already published. |
| GET | `/announcements` | `communication.view` | Sent-announcement history, newest first. |
| POST | `/announcements` | `communication.manage` | `{ title, body, audience, channels: (in_app\|email\|sms\|push)[] }`. Resolves recipients by audience within the school, creates one `AppNotification` per recipient, and — per selected channel — sends real mail (`Mail::to()->send()`), or calls `SmsGatewayInterface`/`PushGatewayInterface` (only a log-writing default implementation ships; see [database.md](database.md#key-modeling-decisions)). Synchronous, not queued. |
| GET | `/notifications` | *(any authenticated user, always their own)* | `meta.unread_count` alongside the usual pagination meta. `filter[is_read]`. |
| POST | `/notifications/{id}/read` | *(own record only — 404 for anyone else's)* | |
| POST | `/notifications/read-all` | *(own records only)* | |

## Reports, Analytics & Search (Phase 12)

No standalone `reports`/`search` permission — every action below is
authorized directly (no Policy class) against the existing permission of
the module it reports on or searches, per [rbac.md](rbac.md#permission-catalogue).

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/reports/attendance` | `student-attendance.view` and/or `staff-attendance.view` | `?from_date&to_date` (defaults to the last 6 months). `student`/`staff` keys are each `null` unless the caller holds that specific permission; each present section has `overall_percentage`, a monthly `trend` array, and (student only) a `by_section` breakdown. |
| GET | `/reports/academic-performance` | `exam-marks.view` | The most recent 6 published exams: entries count, average percentage, and pass rate (against each `ExamSubject.passing_marks`, not a `GradeBand`). |
| GET | `/reports/enrollment` | `students.view` | 6-month admissions/withdrawals/graduations trend (from `StudentEnrollmentHistory`) plus active-student counts by grade level. |
| GET | `/reports/operations` | `library.view` and/or `transport.view` and/or `hostel.view` | `library`/`transport`/`hostel` keys each `null` unless the caller holds that specific permission. Library: total books, issued this month, currently overdue. Transport: active vehicle count, students assigned. Hostel: room count, capacity vs. occupied, occupancy %. |
| GET | `/search` | *(none — each result category is independently gated, see below)* | `?q=` (minimum 2 characters, otherwise returns empty results rather than erroring). Searches students/guardians/staff (each by first+last name, matched word-by-word so a full "First Last" query works — see [database.md](database.md#key-modeling-decisions)) plus admission number/phone/email/employee ID where relevant, books (title/ISBN), and invoices (invoice number, row-scoped via `Invoice::scopeVisibleTo()`). Each category is present in the response only if the caller holds that module's `.view` permission (`students.view`, `guardians.view`, `users.view`, `library.view`, `invoices.view`), and capped at 5 results per category. |

## Error responses

Validation failures return HTTP 422 with the standard Laravel
`{ errors: { field: [messages] } }` shape wrapped in the `ApiResponse`
envelope. Authorization failures return 403 with no `errors` key.
Not-found returns 404. All exceptions render as JSON (never an HTML error
page) for any request under `/api/*` — see the exception handling in
`bootstrap/app.php`.
