/**
 * Single authenticated gate every uploaded file (student photos/documents,
 * homework attachments, user avatars, ...) is served through — Media's
 * `disk_name` is the private `local` disk (config/media-library.php,
 * MEDIA_DISK), not the public one, so a URL alone no longer grants
 * access; this controller is what actually decides who gets the bytes.
 *
 * Deliberately generic rather than one controller per model: `$media->model`
 * is whatever polymorphic owner the file belongs to (Student, User,
 * Homework, ...), and `Gate::authorize('view', $media->model)` resolves to
 * that model's own Policy at runtime — so a Student's own photo is gated by
 * StudentPolicy, a Homework attachment by HomeworkPolicy, etc., without this
 * controller needing to know which. Adding a new media-bearing model needs
 * no change here, only that model's own Policy::view() to already be
 * correctly scoped.
