/**
 * Per-exam average score / pass-rate, computed from ExamMark rows rolled up
 * to their ExamSubjectGroup (one subject, possibly several graded
 * components) against that group's own passing_marks — no GradeBand lookup
 * needed, "pass" here just means "met the subject's own passing threshold."
 *
 * A lightweight, bespoke aggregate across every student in the exam (not
 * per-student), so this deliberately does NOT go through
 * SubjectResultService — that would be one query per student per subject.
 * Grain is per (subject group, student), matching what a report card
 * actually shows — not per component, or a multi-component subject would
 * silently count several times toward one exam's average.
