/**
 * One-off backfill for Sub-phase A's PII encryption: rewrites already-stored
 * plaintext values in the columns that just gained an `encrypted` cast
 * (User::phone, Student::medical_info/emergency_contact_phone/address_line1/
 * address_line2, Guardian::national_id/address_line1/address_line2,
 * Payment::reference_number) so they match what the cast will expect to
 * decrypt on the next read.
 *
 * Writes via DB::table() directly, not the Eloquent models — the models
 * already carry the encrypted cast by the time this runs, and reading a
 * still-plaintext row through them would throw DecryptException immediately.
 * Uses Crypt::encryptString() (the same encrypter the cast itself calls),
 * so the format is byte-compatible with what Eloquent reads afterward.
 *
 * Deploy order (see docs/deployment.md): run the widening migration, then
 * this command, THEN deploy code with the encrypted casts live. Running it
 * out of order (casts already live, command not yet run) makes every
 * existing row unreadable until this command completes.
 *
 * Idempotent: a value that already decrypts successfully is assumed
 * already-encrypted and left alone, so re-running this command (e.g. after
 * a partial failure) is always safe.
